                    An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are
                    the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus
                    sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to
                    North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including
                    Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

                    A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis.           
                    Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes, used for making wine, jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed extract, vinegar,
                    and grape seed oil, or dried as raisins, currants and sultanas. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally
                    occurring in clusters.

                    The avocado (Persea americana), a tree likely originating from south-central Mexico, is classified as a member
                    of the flowering plant family Lauraceae. The fruit of the plant, also called an avocado (or avocado pear or alligator
                    pear), is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Avocado trees are partially self-pollinating, and
                    are often propagated through grafting to maintain predictable fruit quality and quantity.

                    A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the even-toed ungulate family Suidae. Pigs include domestic pigs
                    and their ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species. Pigs, like all suids, are
                    native to the Eurasian and African continents, ranging from Europe to the Pacific islands. Suids other than the pig are
                    the babirusa of Indonesia, the pygmy hog of South Asia, the warthog of Africa, and other pig genera from Africa. The
                    suids are a sister clade to peccaries. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.

                A robot is a machine‚Äîespecially one programmable by a computer‚Äîcapable of carrying out a complex series of actions
                automatically. A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. Robots may
                be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark
                functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.

                A facepalm is the physical gesture of placing one's hand across one's face or lowering one's face into one's hand or
                hands, covering or closing one's eyes. The gesture is often exaggerated by giving the motion more force and making a
                slapping noise when the hand comes in contact with the face. The gesture is found in many cultures as a display of
                frustration, disappointment, exasperation, embarrassment, horror, shock, surprise, exhaustion, sarcasm, or
                incredulous disbelief.
